# Profiles for the production printer Voron v2.4 300mm2


- **PV-Production Tuned 0.3** profile is a wall quality focused profile for all main large growbox parts.
- **PV-Tuned GPv2** profile is a fast high floing, general printing profile, which demands high quality filament, can be used for growbox internal components as well as general printing. 
- **Tuned GPv2 - VORON ABS PARTS** is as it seems, the profile to print replacement Voron parts fast at acceptable quality. **Must be enclosed, and only use ESUN ABS PLUS**


> When importing profiles into ideamaker, make sure you are setting the right plastic type for each profile as different plastics have differing densities/flow characteristics. The profile itself should also carry some printer and filament data with it, so when in doubt, just go with that.
